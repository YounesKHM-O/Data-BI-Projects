# Telecom Social Intelligence Hub

[cite_start]This project provides a real-time decision-making platform for the Algerian telecom market, bridging the gap between raw Facebook data and executive insights[cite: 14, 33, 41]. [cite_start]It transforms 370,000+ unorganized social signals into a strategic advantage by addressing technical hurdles such as the "Black Box" of closed APIs and the "Semantic Lock" of complex dialectal speech (Arabizi and Darija)[cite: 36, 38, 48].

## Data Modeling & Analytics

[cite_start]The architecture follows a Star Schema designed for high-performance DAX queries and seamless scalability[cite: 112].

**Fact Tables:**
* [cite_start]**Fact_Posts**: Centralizes quantitative performance metrics such as reactions and shares[cite: 113].
* **Fact_Comments**: Houses qualitative sentiment data and user verbatims[cite: 114].

**Dimensions:**
* **Dim_Calendar**: Enables time-intelligence analysis and temporal pilotage[cite: 115].
* **Dim_Operators**: Facilitates competitive benchmarking across the three providers[cite: 116].

**Quality Gate:**
[cite_start]To ensure reliable insights, a **0.70 confidence threshold** was implemented on the NLP model[cite: 92]. [cite_start]This rigorous filtering eliminates digital noise and ambiguous comments, preserving a corpus of "certified reliable" data for critical KPIs[cite: 93, 94].

## Strategic KPIs (DAX)

[cite_start]A comprehensive dictionary of measures was developed to extract business value from the data[cite: 121]:

* [cite_start]**Net Sentiment Score (NSS)**: Calculates net customer satisfaction by measuring the difference between positive and negative sentiment ratios[cite: 122].
* **Share of Voice (SOV %)**: Measures relative market visibility and brand presence based on publication volume[cite: 123].
* [cite_start]**Polarity Index**: A ratio measuring brand benevolence by comparing positive engagement against negative engagement[cite: 126].
* [cite_start]**Comment Intensity**: Distinguishes active engagement from passive reactions, identifying the most vocal user communities[cite: 127].

## Industrial Automation (RPA)

[cite_start]The refresh cycle is **100% autonomous**, eliminating the need for a manual Gateway or human intervention[cite: 137, 157, 164].

* [cite_start]**Integrity Check**: A Multi-Wait sequence monitors six simultaneous CSV streams (Posts and Comments for each operator) to ensure data stability and completeness before ingestion[cite: 158, 162].
* **UI Automation**: The flow automatically targets the Power BI Desktop window and triggers the "Refresh" action via UI element simulation[cite: 163].
* [cite_start]**Performance**: Sentiment inference was accelerated by **10x** by leveraging Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) on the Apple M3 chip compared to standard CPU execution[cite: 86, 87, 172].

## Tech Stack

* [cite_start]**Analytics**: Power BI (DAX, Power Query)[cite: 113, 107].
* **Automation**: Power Automate Desktop, Flask (Python)[cite: 156, 140].
* [cite_start]**Data Engineering**: Python, Playwright, GraphQL interception (Reverse Engineering)[cite: 52, 50, 172].
* [cite_start]**AI / NLP**: XLM-RoBERTa (Deep Learning Transformers)[cite: 84, 172].

## Repository Structure

* **/dashboard**: The .pbix interactive file containing the Executive War Room[cite: 128, 184].
* [cite_start]**/scripts**: Python orchestrator (pipeline_runner.py), session management, and NLP modules[cite: 143, 147].
* **/assets**: GIFs of the automation workflow and dashboard screenshots.
* **/docs**: Full technical report in PDF format.
