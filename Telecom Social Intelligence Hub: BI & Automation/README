Business Case

How to transform 370,000+ unorganized social signals into a strategic advantage? This project provides a real-time decision-making platform for the Algerian telecom market, bridging the gap between raw Facebook data and executive insights. It addresses key technical hurdles, such as the "Black Box" of closed APIs and the "Semantic Lock" of complex dialectal speech (Arabizi and Darija).



Strategic KPIs (DAX)

A comprehensive dictionnaire of measures was developed to extract business value from the data:

- Net Sentiment Score (NSS): Calculates net customer satisfaction by measuring the difference between positive and negative sentiment ratios.

- Share of Voice (SOV %): Measures relative market visibility and brand presence based on publication volume and visibility.

- Polarity Index: A ratio measuring brand benevolence by comparing positive engagement against negative engagement.

- Comment Intensity: Distinguishes active engagement from passive reactions, identifying the most vocal user communities.



Industrial Automation (RPA)

The refresh cycle is 100% autonomous, eliminating the need for a manual Gateway or human intervention.

Integrity Check: A Multi-Wait sequence monitors six simultaneous CSV streams (Posts and Comments for each operator) to ensure data stability and completeness before ingestion.

UI Automation: The flow automatically targets the Power BI Desktop window and triggers the "Refresh" action via UI element simulation.

Performance: Sentiment inference was accelerated by 10x by leveraging Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) on the Apple M3 chip compared to standard CPU execution.



Tech Stack

Analytics: Power BI (DAX, Power Query).

Automation: Power Automate Desktop, Flask (Python).

Data Engineering: Python, Playwright, GraphQL interception (Reverse Engineering).

AI/NLP: XLM-RoBERTa (Deep Learning Transformers).
